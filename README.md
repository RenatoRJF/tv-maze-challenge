### Project's Technologies and Architecture

This project consists of a SPA (Simple page application) with React library, typescript and more.

### Why React?

React is not the only one, but one of the best javascript libraries/frameworks in the market currently. Created and used by Facebook, it grow really fast into the Developers community. Even existing other good options available, some reasons made me choose React for this project:

- Rich user-interfaces;
- Faster development;
- Trusted by great companies;
- Strong community support;
- High level performance with Virtual DOM object;
- Based on Web Components;
- Effortless to create mobile version with React Native by using the same development pattern.

### Typescrip

Typescript is language which builds on Javascript and makes the code more consistent making possible the declaration of static types to shape objects, functions and components properties and better document the code.

### SCSS

There many ways to customize the web pages and scss is one of the best. It's possible to create variables and mixins that helps to make the css more modular and maintainable.

### Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler more used for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes the application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module that the project needs and generates one or more bundles.

### React Testing library

`React Testing library` is excellent when we want to write maintainable tests for your React components. As a part of this goal, we are able to avoid including implementation details of the components and rather focus on making the tests give the confidence for which they are intended.

### ESLint, Prettier and editorConfig

Maintaining the organization and the standard in the code is one of the greatest challenges for a team in programming, this is because each developer has learned to program in a way, each has his custom, his favorite editor. `ESLint`,` prettier` and `editorConfig` are some tools that help us maintain standardized code.
